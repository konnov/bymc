MLCuddIDL 2.2.0:
-------------

Distribution:
  * Uses findlib and findlib conventions
  * Now includes CUDD 2.4.2
  * Groups mlcuddidl and CUDD libraries in a single library libcuddcaml

General:
  * VDDs and MTBDDs:
    - New interface for user-defined operations, see module User.
  * Local caches and hashtables
    - New modules Cache, Hash, Memo
    - Possibility to create local caches or hashtables and to control their
      use, in functions Xdd.permute, Xdd.vectorcompose, and user-defined
      operations.

Improvements:
  * vectorcompose and permute operations are more robust to non-expert users:
    if the provided arrays are smaller than the number of variables in the
    manager, they are automatically extended. This prevents core dumps...

-------------
MLCuddIDL 2.1.0:
-------------

General: documentation and again (sorry) reorganizatioon

  * Annoying GC bug in Custom module solved (use of CUDD hashtables).

  * Rdd renamed in Add (to match CUDD names).

  * Vdd and Mtbdd does not contain user operations, which are available only
    in Mapleaf and User modules.

  * New module Mtbddc when the type of leaf are implemented as custom OCaml
    blocks.

  * User operations for VDDs and MTBDDs in Mapleaf and User modules (with
    good documentation)

  * Internal changes

Migration advices

  * Rdd -> Add

  * Functions (Vdd|Mtbdd|Mtbddc).(register|map|apply) ->
    User.(register|map|apply)
 
  * In (Custom|Vdd|Mtbdd|Mtbddc), type 'a cache -> type ('a,'b) cache, and
    related changes to the type of user operations.

-------------
MLCuddIDL 2.0:
-------------

General: big reorganization ! (and new, not fully compatible API).

  * Integration of former cuddaux and mlcuddidl packages into the new
    mlcuddidl package.

  * all the modules are packaged in a global Cudd module

  * Manager: 
    - renamed in Man
    - type Manager.t becomes either Man.d Man.t or Man.v Man.t
      (for technical reasons introduced by new MTBDDs, this is
       unfortunately not a feature)

    - for BDDs, type Bdd.t becomes either Man.d Bdd.t or Man.v Bdd.t

  * new Vdd/Mtbdd module, much more smoothly integrated with OCaml
    programming.  (no more global and not-garbage-collected
    correspondance table integers <-> values)

  * Idd removed (use the type int Vdd instead).

  * new user operations system for Rdd, Vdd, and Mtbdd, with
    possibility of selecting global or local caches.

Migration advices: mostly change of types Manager.t and Bdd.t.

-------------
MLCuddIDL 1.4:
-------------
General:
  New management of objects of type Manager.t, which are automatically (and
  safely) garbage collected.

cudd_caml.c:
  Bugs related to (unsufficient) memory protection corrected.

-------------
MLCuddIDL 1.3b:
-------------
bdd.idl:
  Type of is_var_essential changed.
  New functions: pick_minterm, pick_cube(s)_on_support, 
  
-------------
MLCuddIDL 1.3a:
-------------
Distribution slightly modified (makefile.config)

-------------
MLCuddIDL 1.3:
-------------

LGPL license explicitly mentioned.
Distribution slightly modified

-------------
MLCuddIDL 1.2:
-------------

Call to Manager.set_varmap prior to call to Bdd.varmap or Rdd.varmap is
checked. Last version working with OCaml-3.07 and older (problem with OCaml
runtime C function gc_full_major() renamed as caml_gc_full_major()).

-------------
MLCuddIDL 1.1:
-------------

Function Bdd.is_complement added.
